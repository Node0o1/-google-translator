# not-google-translator
Source code for a Discord language translator-bot using a custom api using Google Translator, discord.py, and selenium web driver with the firefox browser to enable people of different ethnicities/regions the ability to communicate effectively without sharing a common language.

>NOTES: It's a little slow as it needs to allow the translation to happen via browser before returning the results
>and sending the translation back to discord. The alternative would be to pay for access to Google's cloud translation api.
