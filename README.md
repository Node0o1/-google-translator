# not-google-translator
Source code for a Discord language translator-bot using a custom api comprised of Google's public language translation tool, discord.py, and selenium web driver using the firefox browser which enables people of different ethnicities/regions the ability to communicate effectively at no cost without sharing a common language within the Discord platform.

>NOTES: It's a little slow as it needs to allow the translation to happen via browser before returning the results
>and sending the results back to the calling Discord server. The alternative would be to pay for access to Google's cloud translation api.
